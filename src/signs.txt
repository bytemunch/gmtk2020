hello
i never finised this game
i was going to
but instead of doing anything
i had a nap
i don't know why i'd do that
i had a game to finish
in tight time constraints
i dunno
maybe it's poetic
maybe it's my time management
that is out of control
doesn't matter
no game here
thanks for stopping by though
hope you're doing well
see you around the jams
maybe i'll finish something
until next time
- sam :)
